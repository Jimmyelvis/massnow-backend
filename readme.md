# MassNow News Site (Backend) - Node.js / MongoDb

This is the backend sever side a newly completed MERN stack project, a fictional multi user news site similar to Masslive.com. Some of the features of this project include but not limited to JWT based Authentication System, Role Based Authorization System, Role Based Authorization System, full CRUD capabilities with image uploading capabilities. 


## Getting Started

To get started clone or download the repository, this is the backend repository so you will want to make sure you have ran npm install to install the necessary dependencies and make sure you have this server side running before starting the front end. Then rename the .env-sample file to just simpley .env. This project uses MongoDB for its database needs, so you can use a localized version, or signup for a free at **[Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/ "MongoDB")** account and store your database in the cloud. In the .env file is a link to database with sample data. This is so when you first download all the dependencies on both the back and front end, and start the application you can see how the layout looks like. However the link only allows for you to read from the database, not write delete or anything else. If however you want to have full CRUD capabilities you will need to create a mongo database of your own.

You can import the backup MongoDB documents, in the database backup folder to start your new database with if you like.
